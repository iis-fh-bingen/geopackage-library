# geopackage-library

This is a Java geopackage library that supports JRE and Android.
It basically consists of the code from the [Java-OpenMobility project](https://github.com/opengeospatial/Java-OpenMobility) developed by Augmented Technologies Ltd.
We just removed all non library code, made some small adjustments and added Maven support.
